Hi! 😸, I'm Dmitry-a Group Product Manager at Google working on Firebase developer services. My teams owns Cloud Functions for Firebase, Firebase Cloud Storage, Firebase Hosting, Firebase Authentication, Firestore SDKs and a few other things.

Previously to Google, I worked at Microsoft building Hot Reload technology for .NET/C++ developers, working on .NET MAUI 1.0, and creating XAML tools for desktop developers (WPF/UWP), Xamarin.Forms and .NET MAUI. Before becoming a PM at Microsoft I worked in developer marketing helping run big developer events like Build, .NET Conf and Connect();. I also launched Visual Studio releases a few times, branded a few things (hello CodeLens) and was the Product Manager who launched Azure DevOps.

**I've had a long career so here are six highlights to help you get to know me better**

Before developer marketing and Program Management...

* 👨‍💻 I used to be a developer in **Microsoft Consulting Services**, where I worked on some WPF, Silverlight and ASP.NET Projects
* 🤝 I spent some time working in **Microsoft Premier Support**, I was an ADM there building and delivering hands-on training around agile, ASP.NET web development and C#. I also helped customers know what the new technology was coming and helped them through issues
* 📱 I built some **Windows Phone** apps for myself and others when that was a thing as an independent developer
* 🎙 I used to have a **Podcast** called the Connected Show with my buddy Peter. I've also **presented at many developer events** on various topics and hosted others as guests on [Microsoft Channel 9 shows](https://channel9.msdn.com/Niners/LyalinDotCom)
* 🕸 I was a **web developer** for most of my career when I was a developer, I worked at everything from banks to startups. I had many job titles from junior developer to team lead and even architected a few things
* 🚔 In my youth I was a volunteer **NYPD Auxiliary Police Officer** for close to six years, working multiple times a week in my spare time to help keep my community safe.
